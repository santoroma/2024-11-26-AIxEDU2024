# Introduction {data-background="img/002.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 


## Early Identification of Critical Issues {data-background="img/002.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

  - A model utilizing statistical indexes and predictability in the LMS platform
  - Statistical aggregated indexes system built upon LMS data
  - Identifying potential critical issues by analyzing design and organizational inconsistencies within the indexes (data derived).
  - Also through predictive AI (ML) system
  - Highlighting these issues early for:
    + proactive actions to be taken 
    + optimizing the performance of the training system

#  {data-background="img/003.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 


## A Model of Analysis of the Tracking Data {data-background="img/004.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat" .smaller} 


  - From the experiences of digital learning operators 
  - A tool capable of synthesizing all aspects of training
  - A Macro Index of Performance (MIP) as a weighted aggregation of seven sub-indexes: 
    + Results (IR)
    + Study Pace (ISP)
    + Course Structure (ICS)
    + Computer Adequacy (ICA)
    + Community Participation (ICP)
    + Educational Tutoring (IET)
    + Process Tutoring (IPT)
  -  Weighted aggregation by quantifying company experience with an ad hoc AHP Bayesian model (Analytic Hierarchy Process)

## A Model of Analysis of the Tracking Data {data-background="img/004.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 


  - The sub-indexes are a weighted aggregation of different normalized variables
  - Normalized means $\in[0,100]$
  - Thus, every variabes, the seven sub-indexes and the MIP $\in[0,100]$


## Macro Index of Performance (MIP) {data-background="img/004.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 


  - A Unified Analysis Model for Training
  - Enables Comparison and Discrimination Between Course Methods (online, classroom, blended) 
  - Guides Tutors in Differentiated Intervention Methods 
  - It can discriminate different experiences and indicate the expected outcomes based on similar patterns



# A Model of Criticalities {data-background="img/005.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

## Experiments with LearnalyzeR {data-background="img/005.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

- Using feedback from our first experiments
- Analysis of critical situations using the MIP and sub-indexes patterns.
- Also providing tutors with potential preventive intervention strategies.

## A first course criticality definition  {data-background="img/005.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

The behavior of a non-neglecting part of participants that leads to a course experience that does not satisfy their fruition, participation, times,
and performance needs. 

## Criticalities Recognition (a second definition) {data-background="img/005.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat" .smaller} 

- Different criticalities
1. Criticalities from already known patterns using only course data. 
  + Calculated during the course, and the course is already critical when observed.
2. Predictive patterns of criticality with respect to historical behavior. 
  + Calculated during the course, and the course is not critical when observed.
3. Distorted use of times and verification of didactal units at risk. 
  + Calculated only at the end of each unit, and then, it can be summarized only at the end of the course.


## Three Classes of Criticalities {data-background="img/005.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

- From previous definition, we identified three classes of criticalities:
1. Participation (CPA), the access and use of course materials using sub-indexes variables
2. Performance (CPE), the effectiveness of the training course according to the training plan using a Bayesian regressor to forecasting the final MIP
3. Structure(CS), criticality in using educational resources with excessive use of time and expenditure of organizational costs.
- We defined it mixing the expertise of tutors and LMS data (MIP, sub-indexes, variables)

# Identifying Course Criticalities Using LearnalyzeR {data-background="img/007.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

## Visualizing the Macro Index of Performance (MIP) {.smaller} 

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- The first step in using LearnalyzeR involves visualizing the median value of the Macro Index of Performance (MIP) by placing a colored dot over it.
- This quick assessment helps to understand course performance (derived from previous courses evaluation by tutors):
    + <span style="color:gray;">Gray</span>: MIP is not calculable
    + <span style="color:red;">Red</span>: Inadequate performance with many critical elements; MIP value < 50
    + <span style="color:orange;">Orange</span>: Quite adequate performance with few critical elements; MIP value ≥ 50 and < 70
    + <span style="color:yellow;">Yellow</span>: Good performance with areas for improvement; MIP value ≥ 70 and < 80
    + <span style="color:green;">Green</span>: Excellent performance; MIP value ≥ 80

# Course Criticality Examples {data-background="img/007.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

- In this example, LearnalyzeR is used to identify the causes of course criticalities in a public administration course.
- By visualizing MIP, sub-indices, and variables that make up these indices, we can understand the symptoms (diagnosis) and prepare targeted tutoring actions (therapy).
- The focus is on showcasing the logic of analysis.

## Detailed Analysis of Criticality {data-background="img/fig-11a.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

- From another edition
- Participation criticality: Type d, with sub-index Results having a median value of 50 
- Study behavior problems: Users had good IT adequacy but struggled with open sessions (variable open sessions is 60)
- Engagement actions needed: based on combination of structure criticality and study pace issues
- Forecasted MIP range at the end of the course: 70.6 - 85.8
- Expected dropout rate at course completion: 50%
- Macro-index forecasts are above the threshold, but not all users will complete courses



# Systematic Approach to Tutoring {data-background="img/008.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 


## Impact of Criticality Detection and Data-Driven Tutoring Systems {data-background="img/008.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat" .smaller}


- A systematic approach to criticality detection ensures a rigorous procedure for analyzing behaviors and results, providing insights into course and participant performance.
- Adopting a data-driven tutoring system allows effective modulation and analysis of the impact on effectiveness indicators.
- By focusing on predictability and systematic analysis, tutors can intervene selectively in high-risk situations, tailoring communication to individual needs.
- This data-based intervention system enables tutors to evaluate their actions' effectiveness, guiding them towards the best solution for individual critical issues.
- Our criticality model is **explainable**



## Future Integration Features {data-background="img/008.png" data-background-size="cover" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"} 

* Include tutoring actions in macro-index track, evaluating actual and systematic tutoring impacts on results
* Study sub-index evaluation thresholds to better decode critical areas
* Integrating extra measures for Results category with focus on:
	+ Learning assessment analysis
	+ Observed results/work performance
* Improve satisfaction measurement through NLP analysis in didactic tutoring category
* Add AI agent-based actions through an explainable framework (XAI)
